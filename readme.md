This was built using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/) (a JS runtime framework), [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) (an easy to use web server package), and [scetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scetch) (a templating engine I wrote).

To run the server, execute `npm install && npm start`. You'll need NodeJS for this.

There is also a live version available at Heroku: https://web-dev-and-security.herokuapp.com/
